The project is to make (simple) CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions (Workflow),   
using React (Vite) (simple) application. 

Many examples are taking from the [FullStack Open Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11) or are taken from my solutions of the course exercises (see it on GitHub).

Using the [How to run Robot Framework in GitHub Actions](https://qaautomation.expert/2024/01/03/how-to-run-robot-framework-in-github-actions/) I managed to implement simple pipeline with robot network, at the moment the in .robot file there is just 'test' for Log To Console of vars, but it works.
